# SynthGAN
Semester VI. AI ML. Audio Generation with GANs. Trained on a subset of the Lakh MIDI dataset.

Also, find [Resources for the project](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MbYbrj1Kmas6pwyvWHswOO8fOFnfSmam?usp=sharing). This includes:
1. Complete pre-processed dataset.
2. Trained generator and discriminator models for both normal latent space and embedding latent space.
3. Generated audio samples from both models.
